I am thinking I want to do a statement about key words on magazine webistes geared toward women.
My thesis is about the perception of women in digital media, so I think this would tie in nicely to that.
I would want to create a scraper that can run on these magazibe websites, like Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Elle, and extract the key headlines or common words.
