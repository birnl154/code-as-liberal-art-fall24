# first i will need to import pil image library
# then i will have to have a folder of the different body parts for the code to choose randomly from 
#i will then resize the images (outside of the code, just on my own) so they can be cleanly placed together
#the images, once selected randomly, will be placed at specific coordinates depending on their body part type. ie the head will always go at (0,0) and so on
#one will be selected from the head, torso, leg, and feet folder and assembled into one image then saved
#it will essentially represent the randomization of how humans are made and how each human is completely unique. i want to provide many options for each body part so the user will keep getting unique results
#advice: do not go over 1000 px for image size
